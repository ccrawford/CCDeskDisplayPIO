# CCDeskDisplay
An ESP32 + Nexion based stock display / HA controller / Sonos Controller for my desk.

This is a vanity project that connects an ESP32 and a 3.5" 'enhanced' Nextion display.
It sits on my desk and during the day shows my company's stock ticker/graph
and in the evening allows me to control my office light and speaker. More stuff to come
over time, but for now it's replaced a few browser windows.

The exact code is not going to be terribly helpful for you, but the individual elements 
may give you some ideas.
